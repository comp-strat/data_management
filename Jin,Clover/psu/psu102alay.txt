			    1 = Primary (low grade = PK through 03; high grade = PK through 08)

			    2 = Middle (low grade = 04 through 07; high grade = 04 through 09)

TITLEISTAT    51     AN     Title I School Status. This flag was added to the school file starting in 2010-11. It indicates whether 
			      and in which Title I program a school is eligible for participation under authorization of Title I of 
			      Public Law 103-382. There are two types of Title I programs: Targeted Assistance (TAS) and Schoolwide 
			      (SWP). Eligibility for either programs means the school is Title I eligible, regardless of whether 
			      they decide to provide a program to their students. 

			    1 = School is eligible for Title I Targeted Assistance (TAS) but provides no program

			    2 = School is eligible for Title I Targeted Assistance (TAS) and provides TAS program

			    3 = School is eligible for Title I Schoolwide program (SWP) and provides TAS program

			    4 = School is eligible for Title I Schoolwide program (SWP) but provides no program

			    5 = School is eligible for Title I Schoolwide program (SWP) and provides Title I    Schoolwide program

			    6 = School is not eligible for either Title I Targeted Assistance (TAS ) or Schoolwide program

			    The following table shows how TITLEISTAT translates to TITLEI and STITLE.
